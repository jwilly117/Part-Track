# Part-Track
A repository dedicated to the development and demonstration of a part production web app. 


## Ideas
* Have a countdown timer to when the welder will be done
* Countdown to break timer
* Have viewer dropdown of all parts to choose from when choosing a part
* Employee and admin login
* Have negativity timer to show how expected time compares to actual time in green (positive) or red (negative) relavencies
* Look into AWS, Apache, React, and Heroku Database servers (most cost effeective) (probably heroku for something this small)
* Have Live feeds in the admin panel for each robot
*
